    <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
    <p>
           <strong><em>Akan</em></strong>  names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. <strong><em>Akan</em></strong> names have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name</p>
